# FirstRepository - hello-world
<h2>This is my first repository. </h2>
<p>I'm interested in learning about javascript, specifically, how to apply it to mac and ios shortcuts.  I have a few projects in mind that need scripting on top of the standard shortcut actions.</p>

<blockquote>I have no scripting or programming experience.  I am a quick learner and very motivated.  I'm excited to start creating!  Thanks for the mentoring and guidance. </blockquote>
